This Lab report focuses on hall effect on a semiconductor (Indium Arsenide - InAs in this case) and the Hysteresis curve due to a ferromagnetic material (Iron - Fe in this case). 
InAs is setup as a Hall probe and the current, potential and hall potential across it is measured while it is placed in various external magnetic fields strengths. 
Using the measured quantities the hall constant ((7.12 +/- 0.14) *10-4 m3/C), Hall mobility ((0.39 +/- 0.11) *(1/T).) and resistivity ((18.4 +/- 2.4) *10-4 Î©/m) of Indium arsenide were calculated. 
For the hysteresis curve the current and potential across the ferromagnetic material is measured while reversing the polarity of flow of current. 
The measured data is then analyzed to form a hysteresis curve for magnetic field strength and magnetic flux density. 
From this plot the coercivity (60A/m) and remanent flux density (1.42E-08 Tesla) of iron are measured.
